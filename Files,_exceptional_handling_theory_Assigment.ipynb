        "\n",
        "1. **Difference between interpreted and compiled languages:**\n",
        "   - **Interpreted languages**: The source code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "   - **Compiled languages**: The source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an independent executable file (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exception handling in Python:**\n",
        "   - It allows you to manage runtime errors through `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This helps ensure that errors are caught and managed, preventing crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling:**\n",
        "   - The `finally` block is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions (e.g., closing a file or releasing resources).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Logging in Python:**\n",
        "   - Logging is a way of tracking events that occur while a program runs. The `logging` module allows developers to record messages (e.g., info, warnings, errors) to track the program’s flow and diagnose issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Significance of the `__del__` method in Python:**\n",
        "   - `__del__` is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used for cleanup activities, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python:**\n",
        "   - `import` imports the whole module, and you need to prefix functions/classes with the module name (e.g., `math.sqrt()`).\n",
        "   - `from ... import` allows you to import specific functions or classes directly (e.g., `from math import sqrt`).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Handling multiple exceptions in Python:**\n",
        "   - You can use multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions, or combine them in one block using a tuple (e.g., `except (TypeError, ValueError)`).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python:**\n",
        "   - The `with` statement ensures that resources (like files) are properly managed, automatically closing the file when the block exits, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing:**\n",
        "   - **Multithreading**: Multiple threads run in the same process, sharing memory, which can be efficient but may cause issues with concurrent access (e.g., Global Interpreter Lock in Python).\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing**: Each process has its own memory space, allowing true parallelism, which is useful for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Advantages of using logging in a program:**\n",
        "    - It provides a way to record events for debugging, performance monitoring, and auditing. It’s more flexible than print statements and can be turned on/off or directed to files.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Memory management in Python:**\n",
        "    - Python automatically manages memory using reference counting and garbage collection. It frees up memory when objects are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Basic steps involved in exception handling in Python:**\n",
        "    - `try`: Code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "    - `except`: Code to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "    - `else`: Code to run if no exceptions are raised.\n",
        "    - `finally`: Code that always runs, regardless of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why memory management is important in Python:**\n",
        "    - Efficient memory management ensures that resources are used optimally, reducing memory leaks and improving program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Role of `try` and `except` in exception handling:**\n",
        "    - `try` contains the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, `except` handles it, allowing the program to continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How Python’s garbage collection system works:**\n",
        "    - Python uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection. It automatically frees memory when an object’s reference count reaches zero or when cycles of objects are detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Purpose of the `else` block in exception handling:**\n",
        "    - The `else` block runs only if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block, providing a way to write code that should execute when everything goes smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Common logging levels in Python:**\n",
        "    - `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **Difference between `os.fork()` and multiprocessing in Python:**\n",
        "    - `os.fork()` creates a child process by duplicating the current process, while the `multiprocessing` module provides a more advanced and platform-independent way to create parallel processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Importance of closing a file in Python:**\n",
        "    - Closing a file ensures that all resources are released, preventing potential memory leaks or data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python:**\n",
        "    - `file.read()` reads the entire content of the file as a single string, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **Purpose of the logging module in Python:**\n",
        "    - The `logging` module allows you to log messages at various levels (e.g., debugging, error messages) to track events and diagnose problems in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **The `os` module in Python used for file handling:**\n",
        "    - The `os` module provides methods to interact with the file system, such as reading, writing, and managing file paths and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **Challenges associated with memory management in Python:**\n",
        "    - Issues such as memory leaks, circular references, and inefficient use of resources can affect performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **Raising an exception manually in Python:**\n",
        "    - Use `raise` to trigger an exception (e.g., `raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")`).\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **Importance of using multithreading in certain applications:**\n",
        "    - Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can run concurrently, improving program efficiency (e.g., handling multiple user requests or downloading files simultaneously)."
